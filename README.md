# sprint4project
 This project is an exercise to test and apply software develoment, lessons and working with repositories in the terminal. The app itself is a representation of simple visual elements lifted from a dataset.
If interested in using this as a template you can refer to the 'app.py' file and replace the dataframes with your own and it will work.
